### Problem 1

```{r loading the dataset}
library(p8105.datasets)
data("instacart")

```

The instacart dataset contains 1348617 observations and 15 variables. The dataframe provides a description of the orders on instacart including the items ordered, a description of their aisles and respective departments, along with a description of the user, the time of the order, days since the last order, and items reordered.

#### Problem 1 Part 1

```{r}
instacart_df = instacart %>%
  group_by(aisle) %>%
  summarise(total = n()) %>%
  arrange(-total)
```
There are 134 aisles in total and most items are ordered from the fresh vegetables aisle (n= 150609) followed by the fresh fruits aisle (n =150473) )
