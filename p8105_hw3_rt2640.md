### Problem 1

The instacart dataset contains 1348617 observations and 15 variables.
The dataframe provides a description of the orders on instacart
including the items ordered, a description of their aisles and
respective departments, along with a description of the user, the time
of the order, days since the last order, and items reordered.

#### Problem 1 Part 1

``` r
instacart_df = instacart %>%
  select(order_id:add_to_cart_order,aisle_id:department) %>% 
  group_by(aisle_id , aisle) %>%
  summarise(total = n()) %>%
  arrange(-total)
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'aisle_id'. You can override using the `.groups` argument.

There are 134 aisles in total and most items are ordered from the fresh
vegetables aisle 83 (n= 150609) followed by the fresh fruits aisle 24 (n
=150473).

#### Problem 1 Part 2

``` r
dept = instacart_df %>%
  filter(total > 10000) %>%
  arrange(-total)

dept %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = total, y = aisle)) +
  geom_point()
```

  group_by(aisle_id, aisle,product_name) %>%
  filter(aisle == "baking ingredients") %>%
  summarise(total = n()) %>%
  arrange(-total) %>%
  head(3)
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'aisle_id', 'aisle'. You can override using the `.groups` argument.

``` r
dog_food = instacart %>%
  group_by(aisle_id, aisle,product_name) %>%

#### Problem 1 Part 4

``` r
pla_table = instacart %>%
  group_by(product_name , order_dow) %>%

### Problem 2

#### Problem 2 Part 1

``` r
brfss_tidy = brfss_smart2010 %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  rename(state = locationabbr, location = locationdesc) %>%
  filter(topic == "Overall Health") %>%
  mutate(
    response = factor(response, levels = c("Poor","Fair","Good","Very good",
                                           "Excellent" )))
```

#### Problem 2 Part 2a

``` r
brfss_2002 = brfss_tidy %>%
  filter(year == "2002") %>%
  group_by(state) %>%
  summarise(observed = n()/5) %>%
  filter(observed >= 7)
  

brfss_2010 = brfss_tidy %>%
  filter(year == "2010") %>%
  group_by(state) %>%
  summarise(observed = n()/5) %>%
  filter(observed >= 7)  
```

CT, FL, MA, NC, NJ, and PA are the states with 7 or more observation
sites in 2002. CA, CO, FL, MA, MD, NC, NE, NJ, NY, OH, PA, SC, TX, WA
are the states with 7 or more observation sites in 2010.

#### Problem 2 Part 2b

``` r
excel_df = brfss_tidy %>%
  filter(response == "Excellent") %>%
  group_by(year,state) %>%
  summarise(
    avg_dv = mean(data_value, na.rm = TRUE)
  )
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'year'. You can override using the `.groups` argument.

``` r
excel_df %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = avg_dv, color = state)) +
  geom_line(aes(group = state), alpha = .5) +
  labs(title = "Average values over time per State") +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

### Problem 3

#### Problem 3 Part 1

``` r
accel = read.csv(file = "./accel_data.csv")

accel_df = accel %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  mutate(
    weekday_vs_weekend = case_when(
      day == "Monday" ~ "Weekday",
      day == "Tuesday" ~ "Weekday",
      day == "Wednesday" ~ "Weekday",
      day == "Thursday" ~ "Weekday",
      day == "Friday" ~ "Weekday",
      day == "Saturday" ~ "Weekend",
      day == "Sunday" ~ "Weekend")) %>%
  rename(day_of_the_week = "day") %>%
  pivot_longer(
    activity_1:activity_1440,
    names_to = "activity_num",
    values_to = "activity_count")
```

The dataset contains 6 variables and 50400 observations. The variables
included are the week, day of the week, whether it is a weekday or a
weekend and activity counts per minute of everyday.

#### Problem 3 Part 2

``` r
activity_day = accel_df %>%
  separate(activity_num, into = c("activity", "minute"), sep = "_") %>%
  group_by(day_id,day_of_the_week,week, weekday_vs_weekend) %>%
  summarize(
    total_activity = sum(activity_count)) %>%
  knitr::kable(digits = 4)
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'day_id', 'day_of_the_week', 'week'. You can override using the `.groups` argument.

``` r
activity_day

The subject under observation overall has higher activity during the
weekdays compared to the weekends on average across 5 weeks. He also has
significantly lower total activity on Saturday of Week 4 and Week 5.

#### Problem 3 Part 3

``` r

```

<img src="p8105_hw3_rt2640_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png" width="90%" />

The subject under observation has an overall lower activity on tuesdays
across all 5 weeks of observation. The average activity between 0-400
minutes (night time) is lower across all days. The activity trend on
Fridays is on average higher during the evening hours.
